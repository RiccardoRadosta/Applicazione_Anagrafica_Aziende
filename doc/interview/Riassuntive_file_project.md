# Riassuntive file with ideas for the develop of the "Anagrafica aziende" application

- We need a strument to search the data easily with specific request given by the PCTO respondabile
- We need a lof of information about the company (not only name, surname)
- We can use the Feedback to see if a company is very good or not
- We must know the type of student that the company need
- We must see if a company have already same students
- The students can go on the web application to see the aziend and stop
- On the app we can add the possibility to send a precompilated email to a company to see if the company want another students
- A easily web application

# Use case
Generic Users  -> he mustn't do a login and he can only search the company
PCTO responsabiles -> He have an account and he can send the precompilated email and other
Main PCTO respondabile -> he have an account, can do all the thinghs that the PCTO responsabiles can do but can also add new PCTO respondabiles Users
