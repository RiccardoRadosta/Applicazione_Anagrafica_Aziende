| **Start Date:** 09/02/2010 | **End Date:** 12/07/2010 |
| **Project Manager:** David Haney |
| **Project Sponsor:** UMKC |
| **Customer:** Ronald, Vishal |
| **Users:** UMKC Students |
| Stakeholders and Expectations: Team: Have ready access to individuals with the authority to make decisions regarding software requirements. Be given specific and detailed feedback on product increments.Professor Burris: Have a cool app to show to the department at project end.UMKC: Gain mobile visibility with an app students can use to enhance their UMKC experience. |
| **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**: Students who take advantage of the Roo Bucks program will have a quick and easy way to keep on top of their available funds.  Currently students must go online or check their balance with the One Card office.  Adding a mobile app to the available methods will allow Roo Bucks users to check their balance at any time and place they have smartphone connectivity. |
| **Goals and Objectives** : The overall goal is to give students an alternative way to keep track of their Roo Bucks account.  The app is expected to:
- .Provide a mobile interface with UMKC.ManageMyID.com to access account information.
- .Function in a simple and intuitive manner.
- .Provide students with locations to use their Roo Bucks.

| **Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**: 1 project manager at 4  hours per week for 14 weeks              56 hours \*   $50/hr = $28001 requirements engineer at 4 hours per week for 14 weeks     56 hours \*   $40/hr = $22402 software engineers at 4 hours per week each for 14 weeks  112 hours \* $40/hr = $4480224 hours total, $9520 total, avg, $42.50 per hour |
| **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:** Dates are not flexible without prior authorization from the sponsor.  Budget is extendable in terms of hours put in by each team member.  This is at the discretion of the team based on approaching deadlines.  Roles are changeable based on workloads of individual team members.  Roles are expected to shift throughout the project as needs arise. |
| **Approach:** Iterative and incremental is planned.  Feedback will be used from one iteration to the next.  The first iteration will focus on basic functionality of the app.  Subsequent iterations will build upon that and incorporate more features as time allows. |
| **Constraints** : Approval is required from UMKC to make this an official UMKC app.  Any UMKC symbols used in the app must adhere to guidelines the university provides.  Consent may be required from the One Card office to proceed with the proposed screen scrape of umkc.managemyid.com.  We are proceeding with the project while pursuing this consent with the understanding we may not get it.  If consent is denied, the team will create an unofficial RooBucks app. |
| **Assumptions** : UMKC terminals are available and function when we need them.  Remote MAC Lab will allow our programmers to work away from UMKC.  Interfacing the app with third-party website is feasible.   |
| **Success Criteria** : The project will be considered a success if (1) the team delivers an operational prototype at the end of the semester with the features mentioned in the goal section above, and (2) 80% or more of the team members would be willing to work together on another software project in the future. |
| **Scope** : At the minimum, the software will (1) allow users to check their Roo Bucks balance, and (2) see a list of Roo Bucks locations.  Time permitting, the scope could be extended to include features available to Roo Bucks users online, including adding funds to their accounts and tracking recent purchases. |
| **Risks and obstacles to success** :  A risk the team faces is a lack of experience in developing mobile apps.  This lack of experience generates a lot of unknowns.  We have  only a best guess for the level of work required for the features we have committed to.  We do not yet have a clear picture of how the code will be implemented. |
